# E-Commerce API Commands Reference

> [!NOTE]
> This document acts as the central command registry for managing the E-commerce API project lifecycle, including building, testing, database management, and orchestration. All NPM commands should be executed from the `ecommerce-api/` root directory.

---

## Executive Summary
A streamlined developer experience requires predictable, standardized tooling. This repository leverages `npm scripts` combined with Docker to encapsulate complex build processes, testing suites, and database migration lifecycles, ensuring consistency from local development to CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Application Lifecycle Commands

Control the core NestJS application process.

| Command | Environment | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `npm run start` | Local | Start the application normally without watch mode. |
| `npm run start:dev` | Development | Start the app in watch mode with hot-reloading. |
| `npm run start:debug` | Development | Start the app with the Node Inspector enabled for attaching debuggers. |
| `npm run start:prod` | Production | Execute the compiled JavaScript bundle from the `dist/` directory. |
| `npm run build` | Pipeline | Compile the TypeScript source code into optimized JavaScript in `dist/`. |

---

## Code Quality & Testing

Guarantee code integrity before commits and deployments.

| Command | Scope | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `npm run format` | Global | Reformat the entire `src/` and `test/` tree using Prettier rules. |
| `npm run lint` | Global | Scan for ESLint violations and automatically fix solvable issues. |
| `npm run test` | Unit | Execute the Jest unit testing suite. |
| `npm run test:watch` | Unit | Run Jest in interactive watch mode (ideal for TDD). |
| `npm run test:cov` | Unit | Run Jest and generate a comprehensive Istanbul test coverage HTML report. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | E2E | Run the End-to-End integration test suite against the application shell. |

---

## Database & TypeORM Migrations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The database schema is strictly controlled via TypeORM migrations. Never modify the production database directly without a migration file.

| Command | Action | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `npm run typeorm -- <args>` | Proxy | Pass raw arguments directly to the TypeORM CLI. |
| `npm run migration:create -- src/migrations/Name` | Scaffold | Create an empty migration template for custom SQL. |
| `npm run migration:generate -- src/migrations/Name` | Automate | Diff the entity files against the current DB schema and generate migration SQL. |
| `npm run migration:run` | Execute | Apply all pending migrations sequentially. |
| `npm run migration:revert` | Rollback | Revert the most recently executed migration. |
| `npm run migration:show` | Audit | Display the execution status of all configured migrations. |
| `npm run seed` | Populate | Inject default roles, catalog metadata, and test accounts. |

---

## Infrastructure Orchestration (Docker)

> [!TIP]
> Ensure the Docker daemon is actively running before executing these container commands.

Control the underlying PostgreSQL and pgAdmin infrastructure.

```bash
# Spin up the background database services
docker-compose up -d

# Tail the realtime output logs of the database engine
docker-compose logs -f postgres

# Completely spin down and remove the service network
docker-compose down
```

### Low-Level Container Access

```bash
# Attach an interactive PSQL session directly inside the container
docker exec -it ecommerce-api-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d ecommerce_db

# Perform a raw SQL dump backing up the database
docker exec -t ecommerce-api-postgres-1 pg_dump -U postgres ecommerce_db > backup.sql

# Restore a raw SQL dump into the active container
docker exec -i ecommerce-api-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d ecommerce_db < backup.sql
```

---

## Security & Performance Notes
- **Security**: Never commit `backup.sql` files or database dumps to version control, as they may contain sensitive customer data or password hashes.
- **Performance**: Use `npm run start:dev` exclusively for local development. In production Dockerfiles, always use `npm run build` followed by `node dist/main` for optimal V8 engine memory performance.
